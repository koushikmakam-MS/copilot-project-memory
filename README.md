One-time install. Works forever. No runtime, no dependencies — just a prompt.

---

## ✨ What It Does

Every time you open Copilot CLI in a project folder, it **remembers everything**:

| Feature | What It Remembers |
|---------|-------------------|
| 🔧 **Preferences** | Language, framework, indent style, package manager |
| ✅ **Do's & Don'ts** | "Always use named exports", "Never use `any` type" |
| 📦 **Project Context** | Tech stack, key files, architecture notes |
| 🧩 **IDE Extensions** | ESLint, Prettier, Tailwind — per project |
| 📝 **Code Snippets** | Reusable patterns saved and recalled by name |
| 🕐 **Session History** | Resume where you left off or start fresh |
| 🔀 **Named Sessions** | Work on multiple features — switch context like branches |
| 🌍 **Global Rules** | Personal defaults that apply across ALL projects |
| 📊 **Auto-Learning** | Detects repeated corrections → suggests saving as rules |

### How It Works

It's **not a runtime or extension** — it's a **prompt-based skill**. A single `copilot-instructions.md` file teaches Copilot the memory system. Copilot reads/writes YAML files in `~/.copilot/project-memory/` to persist memory across sessions.

```
You (in any project) → Copilot loads your memory → applies your rules → saves what it learns
```

## 🚀 Install (One Time, Any Machine)

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
# Clone and install:
git clone https://github.com/koushikmakam-MS/copilot-project-memory.git
cd copilot-project-memory
.\install.ps1

# Or one-liner remote install:
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/koushikmakam-MS/copilot-project-memory/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

### macOS / Linux
```bash
# Clone and install:
git clone https://github.com/koushikmakam-MS/copilot-project-memory.git
cd copilot-project-memory
bash install.sh

# Or one-liner remote install:
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/koushikmakam-MS/copilot-project-memory/main/install.sh | bash
```

### What the installer does:
1. Creates `~/.copilot/project-memory/` with global and template folders
2. Installs the master prompt into `~/.copilot/copilot-instructions.md`
3. Adds a `ghc` shell alias (auto-grants memory path access)
4. Seeds file permissions for the current project directory

> **That's it.** Open Copilot in any project folder and it just works.

---

## 🔐 Permissions

Copilot CLI only reads/writes files inside your working directory by default. Since project memory lives in `~/.copilot/project-memory/` (outside your repo), Copilot needs explicit access.

The installer handles this automatically. Three options if you need to grant access manually:

| Method | How | Scope |
|--------|-----|-------|
| **`ghc` alias** (recommended) | Just type `ghc` instead of `gh copilot` | All projects, always |
| **Re-run installer** | `cd my-project && .\install.ps1` | That project |
| **In-session command** | Type `/add-dir ~/.copilot/project-memory` | Current session |

---

## 📖 Usage

### Automatic (no commands needed)

| When | What Happens |
|------|-------------|
| **First time in a folder** | Auto-detects stack (package.json, Cargo.toml, etc.), creates project memory |
| **Returning to a folder** | Loads your memory, hints to resume last session |
| **During a session** | Detects repeated corrections → suggests saving as rules |
| **End of session** | Auto-saves what happened (silent, no prompt) |

### Commands

All commands use the **`:` prefix** to avoid accidental triggers. Type them as regular chat messages.

> 💡 Type **`:help`** or **`:?`** to see all available commands anytime.

#### Quick Start
```
:status                                          — Load memory & show overview
:resume                                          — Resume where you left off
:help                                            — Show all commands
```

#### Remember & Forget
```
:remember Always use Zod for API validation      → ✅ Saved as a "do" rule
:remember Never use default exports              → ✅ Saved as a "don't" rule
:forget never-use-default-exports                → ✅ Rule removed
```

#### Memory Management
```
:prefs                    — List preferences
:prefs set key value      — Set a preference (e.g., :prefs set language typescript)
:rules                    — List all do's and don'ts
:rules add do: <desc>     — Add a "do" rule
:rules add dont: <desc>   — Add a "don't" rule
:rules touch <id>         — Mark a rule as still relevant
:context                  — Show project context
:context stack next.js    — Add to tech stack
:extensions               — List saved IDE extensions
:extensions add <id>      — Save an extension
:sessions                 — Browse session history
:stats                    — Stats across ALL projects
:tracking                 — View auto-learned patterns
:compact                  — Prune stale data & enforce storage caps
:verify                   — Check memory file integrity
```

#### Snippets
```
:snippets save api-handler    — Save last code block as a named snippet
:snippets get api-handler     — Retrieve a snippet
:snippets list                — List all snippets
```

#### Named Sessions (Multiple Features)

Working on multiple features in the same project? Use named sessions — like branches for your Copilot context:

```
:session new auth-refactor    — Start a named session
:session new api-migration    — Start another one
:session load auth-refactor   — Switch back to a session
:session list                 — Show all named sessions
:session save <name>          — Save current work to a named session
:session notes <text>         — Add a note to the active session
:session delete <name>        — Remove a named session
```

Auto-save writes to the **active named session** automatically. `:resume` picks up wherever you left off.

#### Team Sharing & Multi-Editor
```
:export team              — Generate .github/copilot-instructions.md (shared rules only)
:export team --all-rules  — Include all rules, not just shared ones
:export team --scope=rules,stack  — Export specific categories only
:export team --fresh=30d  — Only items used in last 30 days
:export team --max-size=4kb — Cap export file size
:export editors           — Generate instruction files for VS Code, JetBrains, Neovim, Claude Code, Cursor
```

#### Backup, Restore & Reset
```
:backup                   — Archive all memory to a file
:restore <path>           — Restore from a backup
:reset                    — Wipe this project's memory (asks confirmation)
```

## 🧹 Storage Management

Memory doesn't grow forever. The system enforces **hard caps** and provides tools to keep things clean:

| Data | Max | What Happens |
|------|-----|--------------|
| Default sessions | 10 | Oldest auto-deleted on save |
| Named session entries | 20 per session | Oldest auto-deleted |
| Hotspots (tracking) | 5 | Lowest touch_count dropped |
| Error patterns (tracking) | 10 | Oldest dropped |
| Explicit rules | ∞ | **Never auto-deleted** |

### Staleness Tracking

Rules and preferences gain `last_used` and `use_count` metadata (best-effort). This helps `:compact` identify stale entries — but **explicit user rules are never auto-archived**.

### Commands

```
:compact                  — Enforce caps, report stale items
:compact --aggressive     — Also archive old tracking + reset stats
:verify                   — Check all memory files for integrity (non-destructive)
:rules touch <id>         — Mark a rule as still relevant
```

### Team Export (Selective)

`:export team` only includes rules marked `share: true` by default. When you `:remember` a rule, you'll be asked if it should be shared. This prevents accidental contamination of team instructions.

```
:export team --all-rules  — Override: include all rules
:export team --scope=rules,stack --fresh=30d --max-size=4kb
```

## 📁 Storage Layout

Everything lives **outside your repos** in `~/.copilot/project-memory/`:

```

          │   ├── auth-refactor/     # Named session (feature branch)
          │   └── api-migration/     # Another named session
          └── snippets/              # Reusable code patterns
```

**Conflict resolution:** Project rules always override global rules.

---

## 🌍 Global Rules

Some rules should apply everywhere. Prefix with `global`:

```
:rules add global do: I prefer concise answers
:rules add global dont: Never include unnecessary comments
```

These live in `_global/rules.yml` and are loaded for every project.

---

## 🔍 Auto-Detection

On first open in a new folder, Copilot scans for project files and auto-detects your stack:

| File | Detected As |
|------|------------|
| `package.json` | Node.js + framework (Next.js, React, Vue, etc.) |
| `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml` | Python + framework (Django, Flask, FastAPI) |
| `Cargo.toml` | Rust |
| `go.mod` | Go |
| `pom.xml` / `build.gradle` | Java (Maven / Gradle) |
| `*.csproj` / `*.sln` | .NET (C#) |
| `Gemfile` | Ruby |
| `composer.json` | PHP |
| `pubspec.yaml` | Dart / Flutter |

---

## 🤝 Team Sharing

Share your project's rules with teammates without requiring them to install anything:

```
:export team
```

This generates a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file in your repo with your project context, rules, and preferences — readable by any Copilot-enabled editor (VS Code, JetBrains, Neovim, etc.).

**What gets exported:** Project context, rules, preferences, architecture patterns
**What stays private:** Session history, personal style preferences, error patterns

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Does this add files to my repo?**
A: No. Everything lives in `~/.copilot/project-memory/`. Zero repo pollution. Only `:export team` writes to your repo (intentionally).

**Q: Do I need Node.js or any runtime?**
A: No. It's just files + a prompt. No build step, no dependencies, no package manager.

**Q: How does it work without code?**
A: The `copilot-instructions.md` file is a prompt that teaches Copilot the memory system. Copilot itself reads/writes the YAML files — no middleware needed.

**Q: Can my team use this?**
A: Use `:export team` to generate a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — teammates get your rules automatically, no install needed.

**Q: How do I move to a new machine?**
A: Use `:backup` on the old machine, copy the archive, and `:restore <path>` on the new one. Or re-run the installer and start fresh.

**Q: What if global and project rules conflict?**
A: Project rules always win. Global rules are defaults that can be overridden per-project.

**Q: Does it work with VS Code / JetBrains Copilot?**
A: The memory system is designed for Copilot CLI. Use `:export editors` to generate instruction files that bring your rules to VS Code, JetBrains, Neovim, Cursor, and Claude Code.
